# Task 30: Optimize QMAC Backtesting Performance for High-Volume Processing

## Description
Optimize the QMAC strategy backtesting framework to efficiently process up to 1 billion combinations while maintaining system stability on high-performance cloud infrastructure.

## Background
The QMAC (Quad Moving Average Crossover) strategy requires extensive parameter optimization involving potentially billions of window combinations. The current implementation needs to be enhanced to maximize computational efficiency while implementing proper resource management to prevent system crashes under heavy load. This optimization is critical for deployment on a 60-CPU cloud server where stability and performance are both essential.

## Objectives
1. Optimize the QMAC backtesting performance for maximum throughput without crashes
2. Implement dynamic resource management to prevent memory exhaustion
3. Add intelligent workload distribution for efficient multi-CPU utilization
4. Develop adaptive batch processing controls to balance speed and stability
5. Create monitoring and self-regulation mechanisms to prevent system failures

## Instructions for AI Agent

### Step 1: Performance Analysis
- Profile the current QMAC backtesting framework to identify performance bottlenecks
- Analyze memory usage patterns during large-scale backtest runs
- Identify critical sections of code that could benefit from further optimization
- Review Ray task distribution mechanisms and resource allocation for potential improvements

### Step 2: Numba Optimization
- Enhance the Numba-accelerated functions for maximum performance
- Implement additional parallelization where beneficial
- Review and optimize the evaluate_window_combination function
- Consider implementing vectorized operations where appropriate
- Ensure Numba compilation flags are optimized for performance (parallel, fastmath, cache)

### Step 3: Memory Management
- Implement dynamic memory monitoring during processing
- Add adaptive batch sizing based on available system resources
- Develop memory usage throttling mechanisms to prevent OOM errors
- Implement proper cleanup of temporary objects and enforce garbage collection
- Consider using memory-mapped arrays for large datasets

### Step 4: Distributed Processing Enhancements
- Optimize Ray distributed computing setup for balanced workload distribution
- Implement advanced task scheduling to prevent CPU/memory hotspots
- Add fault tolerance mechanisms to handle failed tasks gracefully
- Develop a progress tracking system that works efficiently at scale
- Implement checkpointing to allow resuming long-running jobs

### Step 5: Adaptive Controls
- Create a dynamic resource monitoring system that adjusts processing in real-time
- Implement automatic throttling based on system load and memory pressure
- Add configuration parameters to control resource utilization limits
- Develop adaptive batch sizing that responds to system performance
- Create a graceful degradation system that reduces processing rather than crashing

### Step 6: Testing and Validation
- Benchmark optimized code against the original implementation
- Test with progressively larger workloads to verify stability
- Validate that results remain consistent across optimizations
- Measure and document performance improvements
- Verify system can gracefully handle extreme workloads without crashing

## Success Criteria
- Successfully process 10-100x more combinations than the current implementation
- Demonstrate linear or near-linear scaling with increasing CPU count
- Show the system automatically adapts to prevent crashes under extreme load
- Maintain identical results accuracy compared to the original implementation
- Document at least a 50% improvement in processing speed per CPU core
- Ensure the system can run continuously for extended periods without degradation
