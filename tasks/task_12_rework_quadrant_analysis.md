# Task 12: Rework the Quadrant Analysis Tool

## Description
Redesign and enhance the quadrant analysis tool by incorporating FRED data to create a predictive economic model for market quadrants.

## Background
The current quadrant analysis tool lacks precision and predictive power. By leveraging Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), the tool can be improved to create a more accurate model for determining market quadrants, which is critical for the trading strategy's success.

## Objectives
1. Integrate FRED data into the quadrant analysis tool
2. Develop a predictive economic model for determining market quadrants
3. Improve accuracy and forward-looking capabilities of quadrant identification
4. Create a more robust system for transitioning between quadrants
5. Enhance visualization and reporting of quadrant analysis

## Instructions for AI Agent

### Step 1: FRED API Integration
- Set up access to the FRED API (ensure API key is stored in .env as per task #24)
- Identify relevant economic indicators from FRED that correlate with market quadrants:
  - GDP growth rates
  - Inflation metrics (CPI, PCE, etc.)
  - Employment data (Non-farm payrolls, unemployment rate)
  - Manufacturing indices (ISM, PMI)
  - Interest rate data (Fed Funds, Treasury yields)
  - Consumer confidence and spending
- Implement data collection and storage mechanisms for these indicators

### Step 2: Analyze Historical Quadrant Relationships
- Collect historical data on market quadrants and corresponding economic indicators
- Perform correlation analysis between economic indicators and historical quadrant shifts
- Identify leading indicators that predict quadrant changes
- Determine optimal indicator combinations for each quadrant boundary
- Develop statistical significance testing for indicator relationships

### Step 3: Predictive Model Development
- Create a machine learning model to predict market quadrants based on economic indicators
- Test various model architectures (random forest, gradient boosting, neural networks, etc.)
- Implement feature engineering to enhance predictive power
- Develop ensemble methods to combine multiple predictive approaches
- Create validation methodology for model performance

### Step 4: Quadrant Transition Framework
- Design a probabilistic framework for quadrant transitions
- Create confidence metrics for current quadrant determination
- Implement early warning indicators for potential quadrant shifts
- Develop smoothing techniques to avoid false quadrant changes
- Create a transition matrix for likelihood of moving between quadrants

### Step 5: Integration and Visualization
- Connect the new predictive model to the existing trading system
- Develop visualization tools for quadrant analysis
- Create dashboard components for monitoring quadrant indicators
- Implement reporting functionality for quadrant status and changes
- Document the new quadrant analysis methodology

### Success Criteria
- Predictive model achieves at least 80% accuracy in quadrant determination
- System identifies quadrant shifts at least 2 weeks before they become obvious in price action
- False quadrant change signals are reduced by at least 50% compared to current system
- Integration with trading strategy shows improved performance in backtesting
- Visualization clearly communicates current quadrant, confidence level, and potential transitions
