# Task 21: Clean Up File Structures and Generate HTML Reports

## Description
Reorganize and clean up the project's file structure, resolve issues with initialization files, and generate HTML copies of all PNG visualizations for web-based reporting.

## Background
The current project structure has become disorganized over time, with inconsistent initialization files and scattered resources. Additionally, PNG visualizations are not easily accessible in web-based reports. This task aims to create a clean, organized structure while also improving visualization accessibility.

## Objectives
1. Reorganize and clean up the overall project file structure
2. Resolve issues with init.py files for proper module importing
3. Generate HTML copies of all PNG visualizations for web integration
4. Document the new structure for future development
5. Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

## Instructions for AI Agent

### Step 1: File Structure Analysis
- Analyze the current project structure to identify organizational issues
- Map out module dependencies and import relationships
- Catalog all PNG visualizations across the project
- Identify problematic init.py files and their issues
- Create a proposed new file structure diagram

### Step 2: File Structure Reorganization
- Implement a logical directory structure based on functionality
- Group related components and utilities together
- Create appropriate separation between modules
- Implement consistent naming conventions
- Ensure test files are properly organized alongside module files

### Step 3: Init.py File Correction
- Review all init.py files in the project
- Fix missing imports and export declarations
- Implement proper module path handling
- Ensure circular import issues are resolved
- Add appropriate docstrings to initialization files
- Verify module importing works correctly after changes

### Step 4: PNG to HTML Conversion
- Create a utility to scan the project for all PNG files
- Develop a conversion script to generate HTML wrappers for each PNG
- Implement options for interactive features in the HTML versions
- Create a central index page linking to all visualizations
- Ensure original PNGs are preserved while adding HTML versions

### Step 5: Testing and Documentation
- Test that all modules import correctly with the new structure
- Verify all functionality remains working after reorganization
- Create comprehensive documentation of the new file structure
- Update existing documentation to reflect new organization
- Create developer guidelines for maintaining the structure

### Success Criteria
- All files are organized in a logical, consistent structure
- Init.py files correctly expose module contents
- All PNG visualizations have HTML counterparts
- Import statements work correctly throughout the codebase
- New file structure is well-documented for future development

## Resources
- Review Python best practices for package organization
- Examine existing directory structure for patterns and issues
- Research HTML embedding options for visualizations
- Check for existing utilities that may help with the conversion process
- Explore automated documentation tools for the new file structure
