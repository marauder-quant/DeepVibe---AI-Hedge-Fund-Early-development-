# Task 7: Enhance Market Model with Economic Indicators

## Description
Improve the market model by incorporating additional economic indicators: jobs growth, consumer spending data, middle class growth, and economic stimulus metrics.

## Background
The current market model lacks crucial economic indicators that provide a more comprehensive understanding of market conditions. These additional data points will help create a more accurate prediction model and improve investment decision-making.

## Objectives
1. Add jobs growth data to the market model
2. Incorporate consumer spending hard data 
3. Include middle class growth metrics
4. Add economic stimulus tracking
5. Integrate these new indicators into the existing market analysis framework

## Instructions for AI Agent

### Step 1: Data Source Identification
- Research reliable data sources for each economic indicator:
  - Jobs growth: Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), FRED, ADP reports
  - Consumer spending: Census Bureau, FRED, BEA reports
  - Middle class growth: Census Bureau income statistics, World Bank data
  - Economic stimulus: Treasury data, Fed balance sheet data, FRED
- Evaluate data quality, frequency, and accessibility
- Determine how to access each data source (API, web scraping, manual downloads)

### Step 2: Data Collection Framework
- Create data collection functions for each new economic indicator
- Ensure data is properly normalized and seasonally adjusted where appropriate
- Implement caching and storage mechanisms for efficient retrieval
- Add data validation checks to ensure quality

### Step 3: Market Model Integration
- Analyze correlations between new indicators and market performance
- Determine appropriate weighting for each indicator in the market model
- Add the indicators to the existing model framework
- Create transformation and scaling functions for proper integration

### Step 4: Backtest Model Enhancements
- Test the enhanced model against historical data
- Compare performance metrics with the previous model version
- Adjust weightings and parameters based on results
- Validate using out-of-sample data

### Step 5: Visualization and Reporting
- Create visualizations for each new economic indicator
- Develop a dashboard component showing their impact on the market model
- Generate periodic reports highlighting indicator trends
- Add explanatory analysis for significant indicator movements

### Success Criteria
- All four economic indicators successfully integrated into the market model
- Data collection process is reliable and automated
- Backtest results show improved predictive accuracy
- Visualization clearly demonstrates each indicator's impact
- Model produces more nuanced market analysis with the additional data
