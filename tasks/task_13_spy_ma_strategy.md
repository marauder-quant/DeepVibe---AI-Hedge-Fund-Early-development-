# Task 13: Run Semi-Detailed 4xMA Strategy on SPY

## Description
Develop and run a semi-detailed implementation of a 4x Moving Average (MA) strategy on SPY as a potential default strategy upgrade.

## Background
The trading system needs a reliable default strategy, and a 4x Moving Average approach applied to SPY (S&P 500 ETF) could serve as an effective baseline. This strategy would use four different moving averages to generate trading signals and would be thoroughly tested to assess its viability as a default strategy.

## Objectives
1. Implement a 4x Moving Average strategy specifically for SPY
2. Optimize the MA periods and other parameters for best performance
3. Run detailed backtests to assess the strategy's effectiveness
4. Compare results with the current default strategy
5. Prepare the strategy for potential integration as the new default

## Instructions for AI Agent

### Step 1: Strategy Design
- Define the 4x Moving Average strategy structure:
  - Select four appropriate MA periods (e.g., 20, 50, 100, 200 days)
  - Determine signal generation rules (crossovers, relative positions, confirmations)
  - Design entry and exit logic
  - Create position sizing rules
  - Implement risk management parameters
- Document the strategy specifications and theoretical basis

### Step 2: Implementation
- Code the 4x MA strategy specifically for SPY
- Ensure proper data handling and preprocessing
- Implement signal generation algorithms
- Create position management logic
- Add performance tracking and logging components
- Develop visualization tools for strategy analysis

### Step 3: Parameter Optimization
- Define the parameter space to explore:
  - MA periods
  - Signal thresholds
  - Position sizing percentages
  - Stop-loss and take-profit levels
- Implement optimization framework (grid search, genetic algorithm, Bayesian optimization)
- Run optimization with appropriate cross-validation
- Select optimal parameter set based on risk-adjusted returns

### Step 4: Backtesting
- Conduct thorough backtest of the optimized strategy on SPY
- Use appropriate historical data (minimum 10 years, including different market regimes)
- Calculate comprehensive performance metrics:
  - Returns (total, annualized, risk-adjusted)
  - Volatility measures
  - Drawdown statistics
  - Win/loss ratios
  - Profit factor
- Analyze trade distribution and behavior in different market conditions

### Step 5: Comparison and Refinement
- Compare backtest results with the current default strategy
- Identify strengths and weaknesses of the 4x MA approach
- Refine the strategy based on findings
- Conduct walk-forward testing to validate optimization robustness
- Create final documentation for the strategy

### Success Criteria
- Strategy demonstrates positive risk-adjusted returns over various market conditions
- Performance exceeds or matches the current default strategy
- Strategy shows reasonable trade frequency and practicality
- Drawdowns are within acceptable limits
- Implementation is well-documented and ready for production use

## Resources
- Review existing MA strategy implementations in the codebase
- Examine SPY historical data availability and quality
- Check backtesting framework capabilities and limitations
- Research academic literature on multi-MA strategies for large indices
