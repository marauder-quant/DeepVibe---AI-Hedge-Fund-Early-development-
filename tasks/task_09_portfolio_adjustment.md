# Task 9: Dynamic Portfolio Adjustment Based on Quadrant Changes

## Description
Implement portfolio trimming or juicing mechanisms that automatically adjust positions when market quadrant changes occur due to jobs data or other sudden economic shifts.

## Background
The trading system currently uses a quadrant-based approach to determine market conditions and position sizing. However, when economic data (particularly jobs reports) causes a sudden quadrant shift, the portfolio is not adjusted quickly enough. This delay can lead to missed opportunities or increased exposure to adverse market conditions.

## Objectives
1. Create a mechanism to detect significant quadrant changes triggered by economic data releases
2. Develop portfolio trimming logic to reduce exposure when conditions deteriorate
3. Implement portfolio "juicing" logic to increase exposure when conditions improve
4. Ensure these adjustments happen promptly after relevant economic data is released

## Instructions for AI Agent

### Step 1: Event Detection and Monitoring
- Identify key economic data releases that can trigger quadrant changes:
  - Jobs reports (Non-Farm Payrolls, ADP, Initial Claims)
  - Manufacturing data (ISM, PMI)
  - Consumer confidence metrics
  - Other significant economic indicators
- Create a monitoring system for these data releases
- Implement real-time analysis of these reports when published

### Step 2: Quadrant Impact Analysis
- Develop models to predict how specific economic data points impact the market quadrant
- Create sensitivity analysis to determine thresholds for quadrant changes
- Implement a scoring system for the likelihood and magnitude of quadrant shifts
- Design a confidence metric for quadrant change predictions

### Step 3: Portfolio Trimming Implementation
- Create rules for reducing exposure when quadrants shift negatively:
  - Position size reduction percentages
  - Priority order for trimming positions
  - Sector-specific trimming rules
  - Stop-loss adjustment mechanisms
- Implement automated execution logic for trimming operations

### Step 4: Portfolio Juicing Implementation
- Create rules for increasing exposure when quadrants shift positively:
  - Position size increase percentages
  - Target allocation for new positions
  - Sector-specific enhancement rules
  - Risk management constraints during portfolio enhancement
- Implement automated execution logic for position enhancement

### Step 5: Integration and Testing
- Connect the quadrant detection system to the portfolio adjustment mechanisms
- Test with historical data to measure response effectiveness
- Implement safeguards to prevent overreaction to noisy data
- Create logging and reporting for all automated adjustments

### Success Criteria
- System successfully detects quadrant changes within minutes of economic data releases
- Portfolio adjustments execute promptly after quadrant changes are confirmed
- Position sizing changes reflect the magnitude and confidence of quadrant shifts
- Backtest results show improved performance compared to fixed allocation approach
- Risk metrics remain within acceptable parameters during adjustment periods

## Resources
- Examine the existing quadrant determination code
- Review portfolio management functions in the trading system
- Analyze historical quadrant shifts and their relationship to economic data
- Investigate API access to economic data releases for real-time monitoring
