# Task 15: Update Economic Data Plot

## Description
Enhance and modernize the economic data visualization plots to improve data representation, usability, and insights.

## Background
The current economic data plot is outdated and fails to effectively communicate important economic trends and relationships. A modern, comprehensive visualization is needed to better understand economic indicators and their impact on market conditions.

## Objectives
1. Redesign the economic data plot for improved clarity and information density
2. Add new economic indicators to the visualization
3. Implement interactive features for better data exploration
4. Create correlation views between economic data and market performance
5. Ensure the plot is automatically updated with the latest data

## Instructions for AI Agent

### Step 1: Current Plot Analysis
- Review the existing economic data plot implementation
- Identify limitations and areas for improvement
- Analyze what economic indicators are currently included
- Determine which visualization library is being used (matplotlib, plotly, etc.)
- Assess the data sources and update frequency

### Step 2: Design New Visualization
- Create a comprehensive design for the enhanced economic data plot
- Select appropriate visualization types for different economic indicators
- Design a layout that shows relationships between indicators
- Plan for time series, correlation, and comparative views
- Incorporate color schemes and styling that enhance readability

### Step 3: Data Source Enhancement
- Identify additional economic indicators to include in the plot
- Set up data collection for new indicators
- Ensure all data is properly normalized and seasonally adjusted
- Implement caching mechanisms for performance
- Create data refresh procedures for timely updates

### Step 4: Implementation
- Code the enhanced visualization using appropriate libraries
- Consider migration to more modern libraries if needed (e.g., Plotly, Bokeh, or D3.js)
- Implement interactive features:
  - Zoom and pan capabilities
  - Time period selection
  - Indicator toggle on/off
  - Tooltips with detailed information
  - Correlation analysis on demand
- Add annotations for significant economic events

### Step 5: Integration and Automation
- Connect the visualization to the live data sources
- Implement automatic updates when new data becomes available
- Create export options for reports and presentations
- Add the visualization to relevant dashboards
- Document the new plot functionality and interpretation guide

### Success Criteria
- Enhanced plot clearly displays key economic indicators and their trends
- Interactive features work smoothly and provide valuable insights
- Data automatically updates with the latest available information
- Visualization helps identify correlations between economic factors and market performance
- Plot is visually appealing and professional in appearance
