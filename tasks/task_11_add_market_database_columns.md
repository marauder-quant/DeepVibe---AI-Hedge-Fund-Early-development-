# Task 11: Add Extra Data Columns to Market Database

## Description
Enhance the market database by adding additional data columns that will improve analysis capabilities and provide more comprehensive market insights.

## Background
The current market database lacks certain critical data points that would enable more sophisticated analysis and trading strategies. Adding these extra columns will provide a more complete picture of market conditions and enable more nuanced trading decisions.

## Objectives
1. Identify valuable additional data columns to add to the market database
2. Implement the database schema changes to accommodate new columns
3. Develop data collection and processing for the new fields
4. Update analysis tools to leverage the additional data
5. Ensure backward compatibility with existing systems

### Step 1: Data Column Identification
- Review the current market database schema to understand existing columns
- Identify potential additional data points that would enhance analysis:
  - Volatility metrics (realized and implied)
  - Liquidity indicators (volume ratios, bid-ask spreads)
  - Sentiment data (news sentiment, social media metrics)
  - Market breadth indicators (advance-decline, new highs-lows)
  - Sector rotation metrics
  - Macroeconomic correlation factors
- Prioritize new columns based on expected value and implementation difficulty

### Step 2: Database Schema Updates
- Design schema changes to add the new columns
- Consider data types, indexing requirements, and storage efficiency
- Develop migration scripts to update the database structure
- Implement backup procedures before making schema changes
- Test schema changes in a development environment

### Step 3: Data Collection Implementation
- Create data collection procedures for each new column
- Identify reliable sources for the new data points
- Implement ETL processes for regular updates
- Develop data validation and cleaning procedures
- Set up monitoring for data quality issues

### Step 4: Historical Data Backfill
- Develop procedures to populate historical data for new columns
- Implement batch processing for historical data collection
- Handle missing data appropriately (interpolation, proxies, etc.)
- Validate historical data consistency and quality
- Document any limitations in historical data availability

### Step 5: Analysis Tool Updates
- Identify all analysis tools that need to be updated to use new columns
- Develop enhanced analysis methods leveraging new data
- Create visualizations for the additional data points
- Update any machine learning models to incorporate new features
- Test analysis tools with the enhanced dataset

### Success Criteria
- All identified extra columns are successfully added to the market database
- Data collection processes reliably populate new columns with accurate data
- Historical data is backfilled to a reasonable extent
- Analysis tools effectively leverage the additional data points
- System performance is maintained despite the increased data volume
