# Task 4: After Hours Fix, Limit Orders, and Fill Execution

## Description
Improve the trading bot's functionality during after-hours trading sessions, enhance limit order execution, and ensure proper order fills.

## Background
The trading bot currently experiences issues with after-hours trading, limit order placement, and getting orders filled correctly. These issues need to be addressed to ensure reliable trading operations outside of regular market hours.

## Objectives
1. Fix after-hours trading functionality
2. Improve limit order execution
3. Ensure orders are being filled properly
4. Implement comprehensive testing for these features

## Instructions for AI Agent

### Step 1: Code Analysis
- Locate the trading execution code in the trading_bot directory
- Identify components responsible for order execution timing, limit order creation, and fill confirmation
- Examine how the system currently handles market hours vs. after-hours

### Step 2: After-Hours Trading Implementation
- Update the time checking logic to properly identify extended hours
- Modify order execution parameters based on trading session (regular vs. extended hours)
- Add safeguards for reduced liquidity during extended hours

### Step 3: Limit Order Enhancement
- Review the limit order pricing algorithm
- Implement smarter limit pricing based on current volatility and spread
- Add time-based adjustments for limit orders that haven't filled

### Step 4: Order Fill Verification
- Create a robust verification system to confirm order fills
- Implement error handling for partial fills
- Add retry logic for failed orders with appropriate backoff

### Step 5: Testing
- Develop comprehensive test cases covering:
  - Regular hours trading
  - After-hours trading
  - Pre-market trading
  - Limit order execution under various market conditions
  - Fill confirmation and partial fill handling
- Create a test report template to document results

### Success Criteria
- Bot can successfully place and execute trades during extended hours
- Limit orders utilize intelligent pricing that increases fill probability
- All orders have proper verification of execution status
- System handles partial fills and failed orders gracefully
