# Task 8: Incorporate Corporate Tax Cuts/Hikes Impact

## Description
Add corporate tax cut and tax hike impact analysis to the market model to better predict how tax policy changes affect market performance.

## Background
Corporate tax policy changes have significant impacts on corporate earnings, investment decisions, and ultimately stock market performance. The trading system currently lacks the ability to account for these policy changes, which can lead to missed opportunities or unexpected losses when tax policies shift.

## Objectives
1. Create a framework for tracking corporate tax rate changes
2. Develop models to quantify the impact of tax changes on different sectors and market segments
3. Implement predictive indicators based on announced or anticipated tax policy changes
4. Integrate these indicators into the existing market analysis system
