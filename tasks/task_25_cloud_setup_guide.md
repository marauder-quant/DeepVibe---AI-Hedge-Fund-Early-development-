# Task 25: Create Cloud Computing Setup Guide

## Description
Develop a comprehensive guide for setting up and running the trading bot in command line environments on cloud computing platforms for performance testing and production deployment.

## Background
The trading system currently lacks proper documentation for cloud deployment. Users need clear instructions on how to configure, deploy, and run the trading bot in cloud environments to perform large-scale testing and operate the system in production settings without a GUI.

## Objectives
1. Create detailed documentation for cloud environment setup
2. Provide command line instructions for running the trading bot
3. Outline performance optimization strategies for cloud deployments
4. Document monitoring and logging approaches for headless operation
5. Create troubleshooting guides for common cloud-specific issues

## Instructions for AI Agent

### Step 1: Research Current System Requirements
- Review the trading bot's dependencies and system requirements
- Identify cloud platforms suitable for deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
- Determine minimum hardware specifications for optimal performance
- Map out file system requirements and data storage needs
- Document network and API access requirements

### Step 2: Environment Setup Documentation
- Create step-by-step instructions for setting up a cloud environment:
  - Virtual machine instance creation
  - Operating system configuration
  - Python environment setup
  - Package installation
  - Dependency management
  - Configuration file setup
  - API key management
- Include specific instructions for major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Document security best practices for cloud deployment

### Step 3: Command Line Operation Guide
- Create a comprehensive command line reference guide:
  - Basic command structure and syntax
  - Required and optional parameters
  - Environment variables
  - Configuration file locations and formats
  - Execution modes (backtest, paper trading, live trading)
  - Batch processing commands
  - Scheduling and automation
- Include example commands for common scenarios

### Step 4: Performance Optimization Guide
- Document strategies for optimizing cloud performance:
  - Instance type selection guidelines
  - Memory and CPU allocation recommendations
  - Disk I/O optimization
  - Database configuration for cloud environments
  - Parallel processing options
  - Cost optimization strategies
- Include benchmarking methods to validate performance

### Step 5: Monitoring and Management Guide
- Create documentation for headless monitoring and management:
  - Logging configuration for cloud environments
  - Remote monitoring solutions
  - Alert setup and notification configuration
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Log rotation and management
  - Backup and recovery procedures
  - Scheduled maintenance tasks
- Include troubleshooting flowcharts for common issues

### Success Criteria
- Complete cloud setup documentation covering major providers
- Clear command line operation instructions with examples
- Performance optimization guidelines specific to trading workloads
- Comprehensive monitoring and management documentation
- Troubleshooting guides address common cloud-specific issues
- Documentation is accessible online and easily updateable

## Resources
- Review existing documentation in the codebase
- Examine command line interfaces in the trading bot
- Research best practices for Python application deployment in the cloud
- Investigate cloud-specific optimizations for financial applications
- Check for existing cloud deployment scripts or configurations
