# Task 26: Fix QMAC Out-of-Sample Results

## Description
Investigate and resolve issues with the QMAC (Quadrant Moving Average Crossover) strategy's out-of-sample (OOS) results to improve its predictive performance.

## Background
The QMAC strategy is showing suboptimal performance in out-of-sample testing, indicating potential overfitting or implementation issues. This needs to be addressed to ensure the strategy is robust and can perform well in live trading conditions.

## Objectives
1. Analyze current QMAC implementation and OOS testing methodology
2. Identify the root causes of poor OOS performance
3. Implement fixes to improve OOS results
4. Validate improvements through comprehensive testing

## Instructions for AI Agent

### Step 1: Code Analysis
- Review the QMAC strategy implementation in the codebase
- Examine how OOS testing is currently performed
- Analyze historical performance metrics and identify when/where performance degradation occurs
- Look for potential signs of overfitting in the in-sample results

### Step 2: Data Investigation
- Check for data quality issues (look for errors, missing values, or outliers)
- Analyze if there are significant differences between in-sample and out-of-sample data distributions
- Verify that the OOS period is representative of current market conditions

### Step 3: Implementation Analysis
- Check for implementation differences between backtest and live trading environments
- Review parameter optimization methodology and ensure it's not overfitting
- Analyze the quadrant determination logic and how it affects the strategy
- Verify that moving average calculations are consistent across all testing environments

### Step 4: Develop Solutions
- Implement fixes for any identified issues in the QMAC strategy
- Consider adding regularization techniques if overfitting is detected
- Update parameter optimization to be more robust
- Ensure consistent implementation across backtest and live environments

### Step 5: Testing and Validation
- Perform walk-forward analysis with the updated implementation
- Compare performance metrics before and after changes
- Test on multiple market regimes and timeframes
- Validate that OOS performance matches expectations

### Success Criteria
- Improved correlation between in-sample and out-of-sample results
- More consistent performance across different market conditions
- Demonstrable improvement in OOS metrics (Sharpe ratio, drawdown, etc.)
- No signs of significant overfitting

## Resources
- Look for QMAC strategy implementation in trading_bot directory
- Examine backtest results in the backtests directory
- Check for existing OOS testing code and methodologies
